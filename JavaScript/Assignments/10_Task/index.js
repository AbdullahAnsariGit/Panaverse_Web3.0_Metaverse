// Q Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Create a variable for print my name
var myName = "Abdullah Ansari";
document.write(`${myName} \n`);

//Print Current Date in variable using javascript Date function
var date = new Date();
 document.write(date)
